**Arithmetical Operations for given two array**

This project is about to do four arithmetical operation for one Integer Arraylist
and one Integer array.Project is processing arithmetical operation for each same index element of these two arrays
Method has four parameters.Two of them is arrays,one of them is  divide boolean  which determine divide arrays into two or not and one of them (operation) for determine which arithmetical operation will be implemented.
If arrays size are not equal,process will do for less size array.
Output will be in this string format:`number,number2,number3...`
